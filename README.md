# Marlboro Landing Page

This project includes two main pages: a landing page (`index.html`) and a contact page (`contact.html`). Both pages are styled using a single CSS file (`styles.css`).

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main landing page for the Marlboro brand.
- `contact.html`: A contact form page where users can reach out.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet used for styling both pages.
- `img/`: Directory containing image assets used in the pages.
- `marlbo.ttf`: Custom font file used for the primary font.
- `FallingSky.otf`: Custom font file used for secondary font.

## HTML Files

This file represents the landing page. It includes:
- A header with a logo.

### `contact.html`
This file contains a contact form where users can enter their name, email, phone, and a message. It also has a button to return to the landing page.

## CSS Styles (`styles.css`)
